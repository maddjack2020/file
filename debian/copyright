 The initial segment (up to >>>>>>>>422) was copied from the X86
 partition table code (aka MBR).
 This is kept separate, so that MBR partitions are not reported as well.
 (use -k if you do want them as well)
 .
 First, detect the MBR partition table
 If more than one GPT protective MBR partition exists, don't print anything
 (the other MBR detection code will then just print the MBR partition table)
